### Before We Begin

Here is a quick update on this project as a whole; it's objectives, design process, juggling it's different divergent processes, and *why* my blog is embedded within the project (and how this has been a challenge!).

#### Project objective

This project's primary challenge revolves around infusing individuality and uniqueness while maintaining a professional and credible portfolio. This portfolio isn't just a showcase; it's a representation of my skills in web development and design. Striking a balance where creativity meets credibility is the ultimate goal.

#### Research and design process

To tackle this, I've dived deep into research, scanning various portfolio websites for inspiration. Consolidating previous notes and research on proper design has been crucial. Embracing an iterative, circular design process allows for constant refinement and improvement. The footer section for my site is inspired off of {% include 'partials/linkExternal.njk' text:"runway.com" link:"https://runway.com/" %}.

#### Managing a Divergent Process

However, maintaining this structured process faced a snag. The need for a blog page to share updates disrupted the flow. Developing the blog page while continuing the base development split the project into two streams. One focused on core development, while the other centered on the blog page—a divergence challenging the project's coherence. For instace, the footer section has been iterated over mulitple times, and still is under development. Below is the original wireframe for the footer section.

#### Intention Behind Blog Integration

I could have hosted updates elsewhere, like other students do. But my vision was different—I wanted these updates to be part of the site itself. The posts embedded within the project's environment add depth and tangibility, providing a richer experience for visitors to engage with my work. Below you can see the Markdown code for this page.

### Developing Designs

#### Facing design problems and finding smart fixes

This divergence highlighted a key challenge—maintaining coherence between the core site development and the blog page creation. Balancing the need for an individualized blog within the professional portfolio is a puzzle I'm actively solving. Below is the in-progress development of the article pages. As you can see, there is still content missing here, and if you have had the time to browse other sections of the site, a lot missing elsewhere!

#### Making sense of wireframes

Even amidst these challenges, the wireframes continue to be guiding beacons, ensuring that despite the split processes, the visual harmony and structure of the site remain intact.

#### Justifying code design decisions

My code decisions aimed at maintaining consistency across both streams. Choosing JSON over Frontmatter ensured a unified approach in managing content across the site and blog. Structural organization and tooling choices were made to streamline both processes for a smoother merge in the final integration.

#### Bridging individuality with professionalism

The visual choices sought a delicate harmony. The yellow circle cursor and fluid page transitions aimed at adding a touch of personality while maintaining a professional interface. Each design choice embodies the essence of creativity within the confines of credibility.

#### Emphasizing a clear process

Maintaining a clear process amidst this divergence was vital. It's about ensuring transparency in how the project evolved despite the complexities. Detailing the challenges faced and the strategies employed to maintain coherence highlights the adaptability inherent in the development process.

### Concluding Thoughts

Navigating the intricate dance between individuality and professionalism, amidst the divergence caused by simultaneous blog page development, has been both challenging and enriching. The project, in its entirety, stands as a testament to adaptability and innovation. Through deliberate code decisions, thoughtful visual choices, and an emphasis on process transparency, the project embodies not just technical prowess, but the art of balance—a synthesis of creativity and credibility.

In conclusion, this project represents not only a portfolio but a journey—an exploration into the fusion of individuality within professionalism. It's a testament to the adaptability and creativity that underpins every development, every design choice, and every process adaptation.

## Introduction

The journey of a creative project is often a dynamic one, filled with surprises, shifts, and exciting opportunities for growth. This week, I find myself at a crossroads in my personal portfolio project, and I'm excited to share the latest developments with you.
I've decided to redefine the objectives of my project. While my original plan encompassed both design and development aspects, I've chosen to divide my approach. I'm focusing my creative energy on the design of the site, aiming to create a visually captivating digital space that truly represents me. On the other hand, the development phase is now concentrated on two key areas: the home page and the blog pages.

My overall objective has undergone a transformation as well. I've embraced the world of static site generators as a means to streamline and enhance the development process. Specifically, I've I have decided to use <a class="-inline-link"><span>11ty</span></a>, exploring the possibilities of Nunjucks templating, harnessing the power of Markdown files, and experimenting with the versatility of JSON files. These tools and technologies are now integral to my project, paving the way for a more efficient and flexible development process.
I've begun utilizing AI for content writing and coding assistance ase well, allowing me to streamline the creation process and gain insights and suggestions that are both innovative and invaluable. It's a game-changer that promises to elevate the quality of my project and expand my creative horizons.

## Progress Update

For the research and ideation phase I used ChatGPT to assist in my researching efforts. I utilized ChatGPT to help me focus on establishing a solid framework for further research by asking the AI to create me a skeleton outline of topics to help guide my research. ChatGPT provided the following topics to help guide my research for this project:

1.  Intent
2.  Audience
3.  Research benchmarks1.  What the project _must_ have
    1.  What the project _should_ have
    2.  What the project _can_ have
4.  Design and layout1.  Brand and style
    1.  Layout and structure
    2.  Colors
    3.  Typography
5.  Technology stack1.  VS Code
    1.  Figma
    2.  Discord (Midjourney Bot)
    3.  ChatGPT
    4.  Adobe Firefly
    5.  Adobe Illustrator
    6.  _Adobe After Effects_
    7.  GitHub
    8.  Git
    9.   _11ty\*_
6.  _Items marked with '\*' may or may not be used_
7.  Sitemap
8.  SEO considerations

I used Figma to create some additional resources to better help visualize my research. Here is a visual of the sitemap I am planning on using:

<figure class="articleFigure" id="articleFigure-1"><img class="-img-shadow-rg" src="../assets/images/blogs/blog-1/Sitemap.png" alt="The site's sitemap">
<label class="-sm-em" for="articleFigure-1">The site's sitemap</label>
</figure>

## Challenges faced

Project scope and allotted time are two related pieces of this project that I am working through figuring out. I need to limit the scope of the project with respect to the time we are allotted to complete this project. This website will be used practically for real-world application to represent my work as a multimedia designer and web developer; however, for the scope of this project, I will need to limit my focus to areas of the site. Trying to complete a project of this scale in its entirety with the time we are allotted is not reasonable.

The challenge I am facing is trying to determine what I want to limit the scope to. I am initially thinking of focusing on the blog page and homepage of the site. These two pages make the most sense for this project since these pages will be the main pages accessed by site visitors associated with this class project.

## Conclusion

I am excited to work on this project and am thankful to have the opportunity to update the progress along the way using my integrated blog page. If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to reach out to me. Next week's blog will include more site design content and development.
